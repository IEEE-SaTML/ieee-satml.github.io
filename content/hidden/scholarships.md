## About the Scholarships

The organizers of the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning 2025 have arranged for scholarships for students and postdoctoral researchers participating in the conference. The conference aims to offer as many scholarships as possible according to the generous sponsorships recieved from the sponsors.

The scholarship covers:

* Registration fee for the conference.
* Travel expenses to and from Denmark (see guide for detailed costs).
* Accommodation during your stay (see guide for detailed costs).

If your application is successful, you will receive a scholarship guide from us.
Please note, that the scholarship does not cover local transportation costs or food expenses during your stay.

You must book and pay for all the above-mentioned services yourself. **The scholarship works as a
reimbursement** of your expenses after participating in the conference. You can indicate whether you wish to apply for the scholarship during the registration process for the conference.

The scholarships will be granted based on the following criteria:

* Brief justification of your need for support to travel to SaTML in Copenhagen, Denmark
* If you are a graduate student currently doing research within a laboratory: a short paragraph from your advisor justifying the lack of funding available in your group to fund your travel (max 150 words). 

## Scholarship Conditions

The following requirements must be met for you to receive the scholarship:

1. You must participate in the conference. Failure to show up and participate will result in the cancellation of the scholarship.
2. You must strictly comply with the deadlines in the scholarship process. If you do not comply with them, we reserve the right to cancel the scholarship.
3. You must provide the required information at all stages of the process. If you cannot provide it, then we will assume that you forfeit your scholarship.

## Application

To apply for the scholarship, you must register **no later than 8th January 2025**. The registration page is [available here](https://eventsignup.ku.dk/ieeesatml2025/conference). The committee will consider all applications and give their final decisions on 24th January 2025.

When you apply for the scholarship, remember to fill in all the fields in the application form or we may not be able to consider your application.

## If Succesful

If you have been selected for the scholarship, you will then receive an e-mail with a guide of instructions on how to proceed with the scholarship registration. This includes the following:

* You must book your covered travel arrangement and hotel accommodation, and save the invoices for both and boarding pass (only if you fly).
* You must then fill out a pre-reimbursement form that collects all the relevant data. You will have to upload the invoices for your travel arrangements and accommodation when filling it our. Please read the attached guide to fill out this form, to make sure you have all relevant information and documentation at hand when you begin the process.

**The deadline for completing the scholarship registration is 31st January 2025.**

Once you have completed this step, and received final confirmation of the registration, you will then receive the conference registration fee waiver, as part of the scholarship. The reimbursment of travel and accommodation costs will take place after the conference. 

## After the conference

When you return home after the conference, you will be required to hand in the the boarding passes from your flights to and from Denmark (if relevant) along with all the other necessary invoices. You can find precise information about this in the guide you will receive when you have been selected for the scholarship.

Once we have all the necessary information, we will process the reimbursements regarding your travel and accommodation costs related to the conference.
