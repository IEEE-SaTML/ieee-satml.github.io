## Overview

This conference will expand on the theoretical and practical understandings of vulnerabilities inherent to machine learning (ML), explore the robustness of learning algorithms and systems, and aid in developing a unified, coherent scientific community which aims to establish trustworthy machine learning. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

- Novel attacks on machine learning
- Novel defenses for machine learning
- Secure and safe machine learning in practice
- Verification of algorithms and systems
- Privacy in machine learning
- Forensic analysis of machine learning
- Fairness and interpretability
- Trustworthy data curation

We solicit research papers, systematization of knowledge papers, and position papers (see [Call for Papers](/call-for-papers) for details). Furthermore, we invite proposals for our competition track (see [Call for Competitions](/call-for-competitions) for details).

## Venue

IEEE SaTML 2026 will be hosted on the campus of the Technical University of Munich on March 23-25, 2026. See [Attending the Conference](/attend) for details.
